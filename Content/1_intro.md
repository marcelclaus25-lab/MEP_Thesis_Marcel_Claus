# Introduction

At Delft University of Technology, we actively support the creation and publication of Jupyter Books, providing guidance and infrastructure for both authors and readers. The following chapters will explore these tools and workflows in more detail with a focus on JB2.

Whether JB2 is the right choice for you depends on your specific needs. Below is a comparison of different templates available for creating Jupyter Books at TU Delft, a more elaborate introduction and comparison can be found [here](https://tud-jb-templates.github.io/JBtemplates/).


::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} JB 2
**pros:**
- High quality pdf with ease
- Newest technology, still in development
- Used in science publication

**cons**
- Not all functionality from JB1 is available (yet)
- In browser Python is not editable
- Not full control of style
- Public from start if not built locally
:::
:::{tab-item} JB 1
**pros:**
- Bare bone version
- Software developed and support by JB1 developers

**cons**
- Full software installation to see output
- No full control unless coded yourself
- Difficult to set up
- OIT support needed to get started
- PDF export suboptimal
:::
:::{tab-item} TB
**pros:**
- Quick start
- Additional functionality built by teachers
- Full customizable through CSS

**cons**
- Understanding all possibilities and functionalities
- Connecting Github and Gitlab to comply with TUD publishing regulations (but possible)
- PDF export suboptimal
